<p>The Beauty and Joy of Computing is an AP Computer Science Principles compliant curriculum. Our syllabus has been approved by the College Board for this Academic Year.</p>

<p>From the <a href="https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/stem/computer-science-principles" title="College Board CSP site" target="_blank">College Board CSP site</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>AP Computer Science Principles introduces students to the foundational
        concepts of computer science and challenges them to explore how computing and
        technology can impact the world. With a unique focus on creative problem
        solving and real-world applications, AP Computer Science Principles prepares
        students for college and career.</p>

    <p><strong>Computer Science: The New Literacy</strong></p>

    <p>Whether it's 3-D animation, engineering, music, app development, medicine,
        visual design, robotics, or political analysis, computer science is the engine
        that powers the technology, productivity, and innovation that drive the world.
        Computer science experience has become an imperative for today's students and
        the workforce of tomorrow.</p>

    <p>The AP Program designed AP Computer Science Principles with the goal of
        creating leaders in computer science fields and attracting and engaging those
        who are traditionally underrepresented with essential computing tools and
        multidisciplinary opportunities.</p>

    <p><strong>Rigorously Developed</strong></p>

    <p>In development since 2008, AP Computer Science Principles was created with
        significant support from the National Science Foundation and more than 50 leading high school and higher education computer
        science educators who piloted the course at their institutions. This rigorous
        process of development and testing produced a course that reflects
        the latest scholarship in the field and provides students with a relevant and
        engaging learning experience.</p>

    <p>More than 950 colleges and universities offer credit for qualifying scores on the AP Computer Science Principles exam.</p>

Care should be taken to ensure that students are demographically representative of the school's population before confirming their enrollment. Therefore, we encourage you to create policies that promote and enable diversity and to not create barriers that would discourage underrepresented groups from participating.")</p>
