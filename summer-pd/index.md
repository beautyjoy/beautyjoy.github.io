## BJC Professional Development Workshops

<!--[pd-app-link]: https://bjc.link/PD2019App. -->

BJC is a College Board-endorsed AP Computer Science Principles curriculum and professional development based on the themes of creativity and social impacts. Since 2012, we have provided professional development to more than 600 teachers throughout the U.S., reaching more than 5,000 students. <b>If you are interested in attending PD in Summer 2020, please complete our [BJC Summer 2020 PD interest form][pd-interest-form-link]. Or, if you are ready to apply to our PD workshop, please scroll to the Workshop Schedule below.</b>

<!-- ## PD in Winter 2020 -->

<!-- BJC will offer a 5 day computer science PD workshop February 16-20 at the University of Rhode Island in Providence with generous support from the Infosys Foundation at the Pathfinders Winter Institute 2020. This opportunity is for public high school teachers only. If you are a not a public high school teacher, we encourage you to leave us your contact information on our [BJC Summer 2020 PD Interest Form][pd-interest-form-link], so we can notify you when more details about our Summer 2020 workshops are available. -->

<!-- Important Dates -->

<!-- <ul>
	<li>October 7, 2019: Applications are open! Please apply on the <a href="www.infypathfinders.org">Pathfinders Winter Institute 2020 Website</a>.</li>

<!--**NC and SC teachers ONLY**: Continuing in 2019, NC State University and The Citadel partnered to offer PD on integrated project-based lessons that integrate computational thinking, BJC-style, into STEM courses for middle and high school. One large 5-day workshop was offered in Charleston, SC June 24-28. For more information, please email us at [pd@bjc.berkeley.edu][pd-email].-->

## Regional BJC PD Model

[Professor Tiffany Barnes][tiffany] at NC State University leads our efforts to provide regional BJC professional development workshops at universities around the United States. These workshops have been offered since 2012 at low or no cost to teachers with support from the National Science Foundation (grants [13469222][nsf-1] and [1542922][nsf-2]), DonorsChoose, and Infosys Foundation USA.

BJC PD Workshops are led by BJC Master Teachers who have attended a BJC summer PD workshop, taught the BJC course in high school, and participate in our ongoing "Train the Trainer" professional development program. The workshop content is based on the BJC curriculum, but is designed to also prepare teachers for facilitating hands-on programming labs, supporting collaboration, and creating equitable opportunities for students to learn computing.

<!-- In 2019, we will offer several 5-day in-person regional workshops. To sign up for email updates when we finalize our 2019 locations, complete our interest form at [{{site.pd_interest_url}}]({{site.pd_interest_url}}). If you are interested in hosting a BJC workshop, or becoming a BJC Master Teacher, email [pd@bjc.berkeley.edu][pd-email]. -->

## The BJC Curriculum, In Short

BJC, The Beauty and Joy of Computing, is an AP Computer Science Principles curriculum that emphasizes the joy and complexity of creating visual computer programs and apps, balanced with critical reflection on both the potential benefits and harms of new computing technologies. The Beauty and Joy of Computing adheres to the College Board's new [AP Computer Science Principles](https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/stem/computer-science-principles) course requirements.

BJC has a strong design and programming focus, using the visual programming language Snap<em>!</em> and a collaborative, exploratory approach where students work in teams to bring their own unique creations to life.

BJC is culturally situated, presenting programming and computing ideas not in isolation, but in the context of how students interact with computers in their daily lives. In our readings and discussions, we critically explore how technology has changed the world for better, and for worse, enabling students to understand the potential benefits and harms of creating new things with computing. Student readings are taken mainly from the companion book Blown to Bits, which is available for free online download.

BJC is designed to meet the requirements of the [College Board AP Computer Science Principles curriculum framework]({{ site.baseurl }}/ap-cs-principles). It was originally developed as a university breadth course at the University of California, Berkeley, and has been extensively revised for high school use at EDC (Education Development Center).

The newest curriculum is at [bjc.edc.org](https://bjc.edc.org).

### Why choose BJC?

*   BJC teaches strong fundamental concepts of programming.
    *   In BJC students use Snap<em>!</em>, an accessible but full-featured block-based programming language, to explore concepts ranging from loops and variables up through recursion and higher-order functions.
*   BJC focuses on collaboration.
    *   In BJC, students are encouraged to work in small groups, using pair programming for projects, and collaborating online to answer each others' questions.
*   BJC assignments foster creativity and design thinking.
    *   BJC includes project-centric labs, where groups are encouraged to build and design their own games, applications, and more. See [Snap<em>!</em> examples](https://snap.berkeley.edu)!
*   BJC situates computing in the real world.
    *   BJC units explore how computing is used in real-world applications, from Google Search algorithms to Big Data to today's news.
*   BJC emphasizes that computing is for everyone, and is a matter of equity.
    *   Computing is a vital skill in the 21st century; everyone needs to have input into new computing innovations. BJC emphasizes equity and engages students and teachers in discussing how we can promote it.
*   BJC is well-supported.
    *   BJC teachers attend face-to-face professional development programs and have access to a wealth of online resources, including a repository of shared course materials, and weekly group calls.

For more information on how BJC compares to the general CS Principles framework, please see [our comparison guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/curriculum/).

### Who is teaching BJC?

The Beauty and Joy of Computing is taught across the country, with over 600 teachers from 41 states applying to attend our teacher preparation workshops. Teachers are also using our curriculum in Canada, Ireland, Guam, Hong Kong, South Korea, Indonesia, Senegal, Cape Verde, Nepal, Austria, Italy, New Zealand, the Philippines, and Germany.
