BJC has offered High School PD workshops since 2012 at low or no cost to teachers with support from the National Science Foundation (grants [13469222][nsf-1] and [1542922][nsf-2]), DonorsChoose, and Infosys Foundation USA. They have been organized by [Professor Tiffany Barnes][tiffany] at NC State University, who leads our efforts to provide regional BJC PD workshops at universities around the United States.

BJC PD workshops are led by BJC Master Teachers who have attended a BJC Summer PD workshop, taught the BJC course in high school, and participated in our ongoing "Train the Trainer" professional development program. The workshop content is based on the BJC curriculum, but is designed to also prepare teachers for facilitating hands-on programming labs, supporting collaboration, and creating equitable opportunities for students to learn computing.

### Winter 2021 PD Details

BJC offered a 3 day virtual computer science PD workshop February 12-15, 2021 with generous support from the Infosys Foundation at the second annual Pathfinders Winter Institute 2021. This opportunity was for public high school teachers only. If you are a not a public high school teacher, we encourage you to check out our Summer PD workshops on our [BJC Summer 2021 PD Information Page][summer-pd].

<!-- The total program cost per teacher is $2,341. The Foundation will be covering 70% ($1,638.70) for US public school teachers raising funds through school or districts. For teachers raising funds through Donorschoose.org, the Foundation is making a 3X match (previous years Pathfinders provided a 2X match), tripling each donation a teacher receives. Pathfinders will be making relevant accommodations with hotels this year, and teachers will receive fixed visa cards for meals. -->
