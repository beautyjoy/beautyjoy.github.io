<h3 class="text-uppercase text-center">About BJC India Chapter </h3>

<p>The Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC) is a curriculum developed at the University of California at Berkeley and
  North Carolina State University to introduce and engage students with computer science. We have had tremendous success
  sharing this course in the United States, having offered professional development to over 500 high school teachers in the
  past decade. Since India is the fastest-growing economy in the world, and a pioneer in bringing innovation in technology,
  we wanted to provide this opportunity to help the Indian education system adapt to this rapidly-growing need. </p>

<p> The India Chapter was conceived by UC Berkeley students (Aayush Shah, Devyanshi Agarwal and Priyans Desai) in the beginning of 2019 under the able guidance of Professor Dan Garcia. These students completed their high school education from India and have felt that the way computer science is being taught in India needs to be strengthend to be able to better prepare students to drive innovation in the world.This led to the idea of BJC-India to build a platform to boost the drive for curisotiy and research in its industry.
