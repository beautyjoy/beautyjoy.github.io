<h3 class="text-uppercase text-center">About the workshop </h3>
    <p> We will be organizing a free week-long professional development workshop for teachers from 29th July 2019 to 2nd August 2019. It will be led by UC Berkeley Professor Dan Garcia (co-founder of BJC) at the development center of Persistent Systems in Pune. The BJC curriculum introduces Snap!, a blocks-based programming language developed at UC Berkeley, that removes the need for beginning students to memorize commands when learning to program. Our BJC course has been endorsed by the College Board and <a href="https://www.code.org"> code.org </a>, and all our resources are free! The workshop hence aims to provide detailed training on how to program in Snap and help introduce Snap! to students. We are delighted to announce that more than 20 schools and institutions will be participating in the first edition of the BJC India Professional Development.  </p>
