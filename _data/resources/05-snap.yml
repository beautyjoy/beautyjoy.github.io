  - name: Snap<em>!</em> Desktop Application

      Two ways to do this:

      1. Run Snap*!*, click on the Snap*!* logo at the top left, and choose "download source."  This will put a folder in your downloads folder with just the HTML and Javascript needed to run Snap*!* minimally, with no libraries, costumes, help screens, etc.
      2. The complete git repository for Snap*!* is at: [https://github.com/jmoenig/snap]().

      This is good to use when internet connection is intermittent in the short term. However in the long term, this is not a recommended practice because this standalone version will not automatically update whenever our Snap*!* developers push updates.

      Two ways to do this:

      1. Turn your project into a desktop app by making an XML file (using the "export project" menu option) and then loading it into: <https://snapp.citilab.eu/>
      2. A simple tool to embed a Snap*!* XML project into a stand-alone HTML page. Export the project from Snap*!* and the upload it here: <https://arena.csc.ncsu.edu/snap/converter/>. The file it creates is HTML, and it requires an internet connection, but it is self-executing. Created by Thomas Price, NCSU PhD student.
