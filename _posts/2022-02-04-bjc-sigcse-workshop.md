BJC will be at SIGCSE 2022 in Providence, Rhode Island from March 2-5, 2022. We are hosting an in-person [Workshop #402][sigcse-workshop] called "Beauty and Joy Computing: AP CS Principles & Middle School Curriculum" on Saturday, March 5.

This workshop is intended for all middle school and high school computer science teachers interested in the Beauty and Joy of Computing curriculum. BJC is an AP CS Principles course. This past year, BJC developed a new course for middle school and early high school that teaches a functional approach to programming, emphasizing iteration and commands, and including exciting projects in graphics, data, and media. In this workshop, we will provide an overview of the BJC middle school and high school curriculum. Participants will learn about how the BJC 2021 curriculum correlates with the new Big Ideas, Computational Thinking Practices and Skills, and Enduring Understandings. We also will discuss course materials, teacher resources, professional development workshops, and an introduction to Snap!, the chosen visual programming language of BJC. It is recommended, but not required, that participants bring a laptop.
